Hello there,
I was able to finish all eight of the exercises however I did have a few issues:
1. I needed help on "saddle points" and "say" (worked over 20 hours combined so I needed help). In "saddle points" there was one line I needed to use and for "say" I needed to find an algorithm but I retyped it using what I knew to ensure I understood the algorithm.
2. There were two tests in "say" that will not pass as they ask for numbers beyond the required range.

The rest of the exerciese went off without a hitch. I also put these into a repo:
